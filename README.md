# ❤️ Predicting Heart Problems Using LRA (Logistic Regression Algorithm)

This project uses the **Logistic Regression Algorithm (LRA)** to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various medical attributes. The aim is to assist in early detection and provide actionable insights using data science.

## 📊 Project Overview

### Objective:
To build a **binary classification model** that predicts whether a person is likely to have heart disease or not, using **Logistic Regression**, a popular supervised machine learning algorithm.

### Dataset:
- **Source:** [UCI Heart Disease Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease)
- **Format:** CSV
- **Features Include:**
  - Age
  - Sex
  - Chest pain type (cp)
  - Resting blood pressure (trestbps)
  - Cholesterol level (chol)
  - Fasting blood sugar (fbs)
  - Maximum heart rate (thalach)
  - and more...
